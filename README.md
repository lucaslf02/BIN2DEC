Programming studies project with JS

BIN2DEC project removed from the app ideas repository https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas, the idea of this APP is to convert from binary numbers to decimal numbers, following some rules.

In the implementation I used JS and HTML because the project is very simple, the idea of this project is to study programming logic focusing on solving the problem in the simplest possible way.
